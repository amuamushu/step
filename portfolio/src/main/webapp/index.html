        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am an instructional assistant for the data structures 
            and algorithms course at my university. I absolutely love it 
            because I get to help people learn about my favorite subject 
            and I find it extremely rewarding to help students understand
            the course material. 
        </p>
        <p>I attended Google’s Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) 
            back in Summer 2018. It was my favorite summer experience to 
            date because I was able to meet so many talented, kind, and 
            driven individuals from all across the US. Their ambition 
            motivated me to push myself harder in college than in high 
            school and I’m extremely grateful to have met them. We still
            keep in touch too! :D
        </p>
        <p>I’m from Garden Grove, California. It’s a city in southern 
            California, known for its large Vietnamese population. Hence, 
            it is also the location of the largest Little Saigon in America. 
            Growing up here, I was surrounded by Vietnamese culture and am very 
            fortunate to experience its traditions in a community that is very 
            accepting of it.
