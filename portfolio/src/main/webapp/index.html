      <p>Hi! I'm Amy and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
      <p>I'm a rising junior at UC San Diego studying Data Science!</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I am an instructional assistant for the data structures 
         and algorithms course at my university. I absolutely love it 
         because I get to help people learn about my favorite subject 
         and I find it extremely rewarding helping students finally 
         understand the material. 
      </p>
      <p>I attended Google’s Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI) 
         back in Summer 2018. It was my favorite summer experience to 
         date because I was able to meet so many talented, kind, and 
         driven individuals from all across the US. Their ambition 
         motivated me to push myself harder in college than in high 
         school and I’m extremely grateful to have met them. We still
         keep in touch too! :D
      </p>
      <p>I’m from Garden Grove, California. It’s a city in southern 
         California, known for its large Vietnamese population. Hence, 
         it is also the location of the largest Little Saigon in America. 
         Growing up here, I was surrounded by Vietnamese culture and am very 
         fortunate to experience its traditions in a community that is very 
         accepting of it.
